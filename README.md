# **Top gibberish stream**
A auto generate live stream that makes a gibberish word and ranks them(random) with music and rarities to *entertain* your viewer.

## **Features**:
i just said in the summary brothery brother

## **Requirements**:
- Python — (latest)
- FFmpeg — (latest version and added to environment variables)
  - Windows:
    - Download via winget: `winget install Gyan.FFmpeg`
  - Other or don't have winget:
    - Download from the official website: https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html

## **Note:**
- make sure the terminal directory is at the same directory as the main python file
- i don't expect people to use this for longer than 7 days so it might break
- i don't use MacOS or linux so i don't know shit and i don't give a fuck
- if you caught me saying *"I uSe aRCh BtW"* It's **AI generated** It's **NOT** real I **DID NOT** say that okay?
